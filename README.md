# swapdrop.v2.frontend


React website built for my brothers startup - Swapdrop. The backend API for the site was built using Django REST framework which you can find [here](https://github.com/lukasmyth96/swapdrop.v2.backend). You can also find the code for the first version of the website [here](https://github.com/lukasmyth96/SWAPDROP) where I also give more information about what Swapdrop. I built this with David ([Da-Byte](https://github.com/Da-byte)) in summer 2020. Unfortunatley we didn't have time to finish this version of the site before the company folded.
